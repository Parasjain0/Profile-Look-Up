# Profile-Look-Up
Here, I am creating a Profile lookup website where we can sign in and see the other's profile and it has mainly four pages homepage, profile page, contact us and logout page. And this is based upon bootstrap.
## Steps

- First, I have downloaded images and favicon from google.com, bootstrap CSS and JS from bootstrap.com and put all togather in seprate folders.
- Then, I created a folder named pages and put all profile pages into it.
- Then, In homepage I have created a navbar using nav pills and dropdowns in a responsive container with row and column and make four profiles as card and give some gradient to background.
- Then, I created all profile pages.
- For navbar in all pages I simply copy it from my homepage and do some changes and paste it.
- Then, I created contact form using bootstrap form.
- Then I disabled the logout link in navbar.
- And I add some output of my work in output folder.
Thus, I completed my assignment.
