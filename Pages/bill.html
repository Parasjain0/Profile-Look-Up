                        <p class="card-text">Bill Gates is an American business magnate, software developer, investor,
                            and philanthropist. He co-founded Microsoft Corporation in 1975 with Paul Allen and played a
                            significant role in the personal computer revolution.

                            Born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington, Bill Gates started programming computers
                            at an early age and showed a keen interest in technology. He attended Harvard University but
                            dropped out before completing his degree to pursue his dream of starting a software company.

                            At Microsoft, Gates was instrumental in developing the company's flagship product, the
                            Windows operating system, which became the dominant platform for personal computers
                            worldwide. He also played a critical role in developing other software products, including
                            Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer.

                            Gates' leadership and vision helped Microsoft become one of the world's largest and most
                            successful software companies. He served as the company's CEO from 1995 until 2000 and
                            remained as chairman until 2014. He is now a technology advisor to Microsoft's current CEO,
                            Satya Nadella.

                            Apart from his business accomplishments, Bill Gates is also known for his philanthropy. He
                            and his wife Melinda established the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the largest
                            charitable organizations in the world, with a focus on global health, education, and poverty
                            reduction. Through their foundation, the Gates have donated billions of dollars to support
                            various causes and initiatives worldwide.

                            In addition to his philanthropic work, Gates is a well-known author and has written several
                            books on technology and business, including "The Road Ahead" and "Business @ the Speed of
                            Thought." He is also a member of several prestigious organizations, including the American
                            Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering.</p>
