                        <p class="card-text">Ratan Tata is an Indian industrialist, philanthropist, and former chairman
                            of Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata Group. He was born on December 28, 1937, in
                            Mumbai, India.
                            Ratan Tata joined the Tata Group in 1962 and served in various capacities before becoming
                            the chairman of the group in 1991. During his tenure as chairman, he oversaw the growth and
                            diversification of the Tata Group, which today comprises over 100 companies with operations
                            in more than 100 countries.

                            Under Ratan Tata's leadership, the Tata Group made several significant acquisitions,
                            including Tetley Tea, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus Steel. He is also credited with launching
                            the world's cheapest car, the Tata Nano.

                            Apart from his corporate achievements, Ratan Tata is known for his philanthropy and social
                            initiatives. He has established the Tata Trusts, which focus on education, healthcare, and
                            rural development in India. He is also a member of several international organizations,
                            including the board of directors of the Ford Foundation and the International Olympic
                            Committee's Ethics Commission.

                            In recognition of his contributions to business and philanthropy, Ratan Tata has received
                            numerous awards and honors, including the Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan, two of India's
                            highest civilian honors.</p>
