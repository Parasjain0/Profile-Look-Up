                        <p class="card-text">Jeff Bezos is an American entrepreneur, investor, and philanthropist, best
                            known as the founder, former CEO, and chairman of Amazon.com. He was born on January 12,
                            1964, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

                            After graduating from Princeton University, Jeff Bezos worked on Wall Street for several
                            years before starting Amazon.com in 1994. Initially an online bookstore, Amazon grew rapidly
                            and soon diversified into other areas, such as electronics, clothing, and cloud computing.

                            Under Bezos' leadership, Amazon became one of the world's largest and most successful
                            companies, with a market capitalization of over $1 trillion. He is credited with developing
                            several innovative business strategies, such as using customer data to improve product
                            recommendations and investing heavily in logistics and delivery infrastructure.

                            In addition to his business achievements, Jeff Bezos is also known for his philanthropy and
                            social initiatives. In 2018, he launched the Bezos Day One Fund, which focuses on two areas:
                            funding nonprofit organizations that help homeless families, and creating a network of
                            high-quality, full-scholarship, Montessori-inspired preschools in underserved communities.

                            Bezos is also interested in space exploration and is the founder of Blue Origin, a
                            spaceflight company focused on developing reusable rockets and spacecraft for commercial
                            use.

                            In 2021, Bezos stepped down as CEO of Amazon to focus on his other ventures, including Blue
                            Origin and the Bezos Day One Fund. He remains one of the world's wealthiest individuals,
                            with an estimated net worth of over $100 billion.</p>
